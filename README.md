# data-pipeline
A repository of sample code to conceptualize a cloud-based data pipeline.
The primary puprose of this repository is to provide sample code for implementating a data pipeline to ingest, tranform and curate data into a data lake for BI reporting and analytics consumption using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) native services.

A depicted in the diagram below, the sample scenario involves the following processes:
1. Ingesting files into AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) object store in raw form
2. Transforming the ingested data 
3. Curating and shaping data for BI reporting and analysis consumption.
